## Background readings in NLG
For those unfamiliar with NLG, below are some fantastic starting points
1. [Survey of the State of the Art in Natural Language Generation: Core tasks, applications and evaluation](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11173)
2. [Pre-trained Language Models for Text Generation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05273.pdf)
3. [Neural Natural Language Generation: A Survey on Multilinguality, Multimodality, Controllability and Learning](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12918)
4. [Decoding Methods in Neural Language Generation: A Survey](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/9/355)
