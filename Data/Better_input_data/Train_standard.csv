['teamName | NEC'];De inzet zeilde onder luid gejoel over het doel van NEC.
['teamName | Heracles', 'teamName | Nijmegenaren'];De Nijmegenaren zetten in op standaardsituaties, waarbij de ploeg de strafschopstip overbevolkte in de hoop de defensie van Heracles te verontrusten.
['teamName | Heraclieden'];Dat leidde niet direct tot kansen, ondanks wat lichte paniek bij de Heraclieden.
['teamName | Heracles'];Heracles werd sterker en vond elkaar steeds beter.

['goalkeeperName | Kenneth_Vermeer', 'halfTimeScore | 2-1', 'matchTime | bij_rust', 'positionOfPlayer | doelman', 'teamName | AZ'];Daarna stapelden de kansen zich op voor AZ en dat het bij rust slechts 2-1 stond voor de Alkmaarders, was vooral de verdienste van doelman Kenneth Vermeer.
['goalName | Markus_Henriksen', 'goalScore | gelijkmaker', 'matchTime | halverwege_de_eerste_helft', 'playerName | Miquel_Nelom'];Markus Henriksen tekende halverwege de eerste helft voor de gelijkmaker, nadat hij Miquel Nelom met een kapbeweging in de luren had gelegd.

['coachName | trainer_Phillip_Cocu', 'playerName | Locadia', 'positionOfPlayer | spits'];Hij was gepasseerd door trainer Phillip Cocu, die de voorkeur gaf aan Locadia in de spits en ook Luuks broer Siem de Jong mocht starten.
['matchTime | voor_rust'];Er kwamen voor rust nog wat kansjes voor PSV, al deed ADO in de slotfase van de eerste helft wat meer van zich spreken.
['chanceForName | Mike_Havenaar', 'chanceForType | kopte', 'matchTime | in_de_35ste_minuut'];Zo kopte Mike Havenaar in de 35ste minuut rakelings naast.
['disallowedGoalName | Havenaar', 'disallowedGoalType | kopte', 'matchTime | kort_na_rust'];Havenaar kopte kort na rust wel raak, maar zag tot zijn verbijstering dat de treffer werd afgekeurd vanwege buitenspel, al bleek dat een juiste beslissing.

['chanceForNumber | twee', 'goalScore | voorsprong', 'numberOfSeasonGoals | eerste', 'positionOfPlayer | middenvelder', 'teamName | thuisclub'];De middenvelder mocht zijn eerste competitietreffer sinds november vorig jaar vieren, nadat de thuisclub tot twee keer toe dicht bij een voorsprong was geweest.
['chanceForName | Iliass_Bel_Hassani', 'chanceForName | Thomas_Bruns', 'goalkeeperName | Brad_Jones', 'positionOfPlayer | doelman'];Iliass Bel Hassani schoot rakelings naast en Thomas Bruns schrok kennelijk zo van een slippertje van doelman Brad Jones dat hij de bal niet in een leeg doel wist te koppen.

['injuredName | Eljero_Elia', 'injuryType | schouderblessure', 'positionOfPlayer | rechtsbuiten', 'teamName | Watford'];De van Watford overgekomen rechtsbuiten verving Eljero Elia, die met een schouderblessure voorlopig aan de kant staat.

['goalkeeperName | Erwin_Mulder', 'matchTime | Niet_veel_later', 'teamName | FC_Groningen'];Niet veel later kreeg de oud-aanvaller van FC Groningen wederom een dot van een kans, maar zag hij Erwin Mulder zijn schot pareren.
['matchTime | bij_de_rust'];Dat er bij de rust niet meer was gescoord, had vooral te maken met gebrek aan scherpte bij beide elftallen.
['goalName | Henk_Veerman', 'goalScore | gelijkmaker', 'goalkeeperName | Kostas_Lamprou', 'matchTime | Vrijwel_direct_na_rust', 'teamName | Heerenveen'];Vrijwel direct na rust maakte Henk Veerman de verdiende gelijkmaker voor Heerenveen door vanuit een scrimmage het leder achter Kostas Lamprou te werken: 1-1.

['homeAway | in_eigen_huis', 'teamName | Groningen'];Groningen had in eigen huis wel het balbezit, maar deed daar veel te weinig mee.
['goalScore | op_voorsprong', 'matchTime | in_de_achtste_minuut', 'teamName | De_Graafschap', 'teamName | thuisploeg'];De thuisploeg leek nauwelijks geïnspireerd en dat De Graafschap in de achtste minuut op voorsprong kwam, was weliswaar verrassend, maar niet geheel onverdiend.

['matchTime | In_de_tweede_helft'];In de tweede helft gingen beide ploegen voor de winst.
['stadiumPlayed | Euroborg'];Voor het publiek in de Euroborg leverde dat meer spektakel op met kansen aan beide kanten.
['assistName | Idrissi', 'assistType | voorzet', 'goalName | Hedwiges_Maduro', 'goalType | kopte', 'matchTime | kwartier_voor_tijd', 'teamName | Groningen'];Die van Groningen waren talrijker en een kwartier voor tijd kopte Hedwiges Maduro raak na een voorzet van Idrissi aan de rechterkant.

['coachName | Peter_Bosz', 'playerName | Traoré', 'playerNationality | Burkina_Faso'];De international van Burkina Faso was de afgelopen weken namens zijn vaderland actief op de Afrika Cup en nadat hij afgelopen week weer aansloot bij de groep, kreeg Traoré gelijk een startplek van trainer Peter Bosz.
['coachName | Alex_Pastoor', 'matchTime | zondagmiddag', 'teamName | Rotterdam'];De bezoekers uit Rotterdam kwamen vooral voor een puntje deze zondagmiddag en trainer Alex Pastoor had zijn elftal de opdacht gegeven om vrij compact te staan.
['matchTime | voor_rust', 'teamName | Ajax'];Dat lukte voor rust vrij aardig, waardoor Ajax moeite had met het creëren van kansen.
['goalScore | op_voorsprong', 'hasScored | True', 'matchTime | voor_rust', 'teamName | Amsterdammers'];Toch slaagden de Amsterdammers erin om voor rust op voorsprong te komen.

['chanceForType | kopbal_die_van_de_lijn_werd_gehaald', 'matchTime | In_het_restant_van_de_wedstrijd', 'teamName | Ajax'];In het restant van de wedstrijd bleef Ajax de betere ploeg, maar veel verder dan een kopbal die van de lijn werd gehaald kwam de thuisploeg niet.
['teamName | Ajax'];Zodoende pakte Ajax andermaal drie belangrijke punten in de titelstrijd en is het gat met Feyenoord weer verkleind naar vijf punten.
['hasLostTeam | Vitesse', 'hasWonTeam | Willem_II', 'matchDate | zaterdag'];Willem II heeft zaterdag een belangrijke en verrassende zege geboekt op Vitesse.
['goalName | Terell_Ondaan', 'goalScore | enige', 'injuryType | zware_knieblessure', 'matchTime | na_ruim_een_uur', 'stadiumPlayed | Arnhem'];In Arnhem zorgde Terell Ondaan, net teruggekeerd van een zware knieblessure, na ruim een uur voor het enige doelpunt in het bijzonder saaie duel: 0-1.

['chanceForType | schot', 'goalScore | op_voorsprong', 'teamName | thuisploeg'];Dat schot leek een offensief van de thuisploeg in te luiden, maar het was Willem II dat op voorsprong kwam.
['assistName | Lucas_Andersen', 'assistType | hoekschop', 'goalName | Ondaan', 'goalType | knikte_knap_binnen'];Ondaan knikte knap binnen uit een hoekschop van Lucas Andersen.
